### DisplayManager

##### Abstract:
DisplayManager is a C program which I sort in the category »GtkIndicatorApp«. This group of projects contains applications written in C, which are working as helpers controlled via a trayicon-menu. This is the second project of this category, but I will publish more GtkIndicatorApp's soon. <br />
The DisplayManager is a tool which should handle the screen outputs, formatted for special screens via a trayicon-menu. <br />
This project was brought into the world because I have a beamer, where I want to manually control its resolutions. Full HD is used for films, but a custom resolution, which also gets set by this application, is used for text and presentations. <br />
This application is based on GTK and LibAppIndicator.
